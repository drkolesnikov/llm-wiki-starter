# Wiki Starter Hardening

## Outcome

The starter repo has a visible sprint structure for the six open GitHub issues, with foundation, search, and health-lint workflows in place.

## Scope

- In: GitHub labels, GitHub milestones, issue milestone assignment, issue labels, local milestone pages, this workstream, M1 foundation implementation, and M2 scale-readiness implementation.
- Out: follow-up issue execution beyond the starter hardening milestone set.
