# Agent Runbook

Use this runbook after reading `AGENTS.md`. It tells a cold-start agent how to navigate the repo, route artifacts, and finish work without relying on chat history.

## Cold-Start Checklist

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `docs/workflow.md`.
3. Read `meta/index.md`.
4. Read `meta/source-registry.md`.
5. Read `docs/source-ingest-policy.md` before ingesting, deriving, or summarizing a source.
6. Read `docs/obsidian-conventions.md` before creating or materially changing durable wiki pages.
7. Read `docs/query-workflow.md` before promoting a query answer into a durable artifact.
8. Read `docs/search.md` when index/workstream navigation is not enough.
9. Read `docs/wiki-health-lint.md` before running or filing wiki health checks.
10. Inspect the issue, workstream, source folder, note, review, or decision that scopes the task.
11. Keep edits scoped to that workflow.

If there is no active workstream or issue, do not invent one unless the task explicitly asks for it.

## Artifact Routing

| Work type | Primary destination | Template or guide | Required control updates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workstream planning | `projects/workstreams/` | `docs/templates/workstream.md` | `meta/index.md`, `meta/log.md` |
| Milestones | `projects/milestones/` | local README guidance | `meta/index.md`, `meta/log.md` |
| External originals | external source vault | `raw/external/README.md` | `meta/source-registry.md`, `meta/log.md` |
| Small raw sources | `raw/sources/YYYY-MM-DD_source-slug/` | `raw/sources/README.md` | `meta/source-registry.md`, `meta/log.md` |
| PDF derivatives | `raw/derived/<source-id>/` | `tools/source-ingest/pdf/README.md` | `meta/source-registry.md`, `meta/index.md`, `meta/log.md` |
| EPUB derivatives | `raw/derived/<source-id>/` | `tools/source-ingest/epub/README.md` | `meta/source-registry.md`, `meta/index.md`, `meta/log.md` |
| Source summaries | source-linked note near relevant workflow | `docs/templates/source-summary.md` | `meta/source-registry.md`, `meta/index.md`, `meta/log.md` |
| Knowledge notes | `knowledge/` | `docs/templates/knowledge-note.md` | `meta/index.md`, source links, `meta/log.md` |
| Query-derived synthesis | smallest matching route, usually `knowledge/`, `reviews/`, or `projects/` | `docs/query-workflow.md`, `docs/templates/query-synthesis.md` | `meta/index.md`, source links, `meta/log.md` |
| Reviews | `reviews/` | `docs/templates/review.md` | related artifact links, `meta/index.md`, `meta/log.md` |
| Wiki health checks | `reviews/` | `docs/wiki-health-lint.md`, `reviews/wiki-health-check-template.md` | related artifact links, `meta/index.md`, `meta/log.md` |
| Decisions | `projects/` or `docs/decisions/` if added | `docs/templates/decision.md` | `meta/index.md`, `meta/log.md` |
| Agent tasks | host issue tracker or `projects/workstreams/` | `docs/templates/agent-task.md` | active workstream link |
| Navigation and control | `meta/` and `docs/` | existing file style | `meta/log.md` |

## Source And Truth Rules

Use source tiers when sources disagree:

1. `primary`: direct authority for the current domain.
2. `secondary`: strong supporting source.
3. `reference`: useful lookup or background source.
4. `background`: context only.
5. `restricted`: known to the repo but not copied or broadly derived.

Higher-tier sources should be visible in source notes and knowledge notes. If a lower-tier source conflicts with a higher-tier source, preserve the disagreement as `conflicted` rather than smoothing it away.

## Required Updates

Update `meta/index.md` when a durable artifact is created, moved, deprecated, or materially changed.

Update `meta/source-registry.md` when a new source folder is added, a source is used across multiple artifacts, source disagreement matters, or a derivative folder is created under `raw/derived/<source-id>/`.

Append `meta/log.md` when durable artifacts, source ingest outputs, navigation, templates, tools, or agent instructions change.

## Wiki And Query Rules

Use standard Markdown links as canonical internal links. Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]` are allowed as secondary graph hints, but v1 validation only checks standard Markdown links.

Promote query answers only when they create reusable value. Durable query-derived artifacts must stand on their own without chat history, cite registered sources when factual, and mark uncertainty explicitly.

Use search in order: `meta/index.md`, active workstream or source registry, durable Markdown search, then `raw/derived/` only for source work. `raw/external/` is not part of normal search.

Use wiki health lint as an advisory review pass. `uv run python tools/validate_repo.py --health-report` prints non-blocking signals; semantic findings still require source inspection.

## CI Validation

If the host repository has CI, preserve or add a validation path that runs `uv run python tools/validate_repo.py` from `llm-wiki/`. Agents should still run the validator locally before handoff because CI is a backstop, not a substitute for local verification.

## Definition Of Done

Agent work is complete when:

- the artifact is in the right directory
- the artifact uses the relevant template or local README convention
- source links are traceable when factual content was added
- uncertainty is marked as `needs-review` or `conflicted`
- required control files are updated
- `uv run python tools/validate_repo.py` has run when workflow, metadata, links, sources, or durable artifacts changed
- any relevant CI validation path has been preserved
- verification has run and skipped checks are reported
